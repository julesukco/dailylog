from root directory:

Installing exercism.io
	Setup per the instructions on the site.
	Installed java
		brew tap caskroom/cask
		brew cask install java
		brew install gradle
		
	git clone HelloWorld
	In IntelliJ, tried to run the app. Clicked New SDK, and it automatically found the
	new 1.8 SDK directory. Click Ok, and compile errors - lots!
	Had to set the project language level in the File -> Project Structure
	Missing junit classes
		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21369953/need-help-installing-junit-on-mac-how-to-add-junit-to-path-environmental-variabl 
		downloaded jars to new dir ~/java
		added new lib pointed to the ~/java directory
		everything compiled ok after that.
	
	Installed BBEdit as a replacement for TextWrangler (no longer supported).
		nice feature - it includes git supported builtin. 
		onthing to config - just picks up from the file system - nice!
